	<div class="chicken"><h2>Chicken</h2>chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. </div>
	<div class="mutton"><h2>Mutton</h2>Lamb, hogget, and mutton, generically sheep meat,[1] are the meat of domestic sheep, Ovis aries.A sheep in its first year is a lamb and its meat is also lamb.

Generally, "hogget" and "sheep meat" are not used by consumers outside New Zealand South Africa and Australia, only the industry.Lamb is the most expensive of the three types and in recent decades sheep meat is increasingly only retailed as "lamb", sometimes stretching the accepted distinctions given above. </div>
	<div class="fish"><h2>Fish</h2>Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. </div>
